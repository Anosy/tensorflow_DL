# 本部分将代码分为三个部分
## 第一部分训练模型的前向传播函数的定义
## 第二部分模型的训练函数
After 1000 training steps, loss on training batch is 0.180803<br>
After 2000 training steps, loss on training batch is 0.150129<br>
After 3000 training steps, loss on training batch is 0.126276<br>
After 4000 training steps, loss on training batch is 0.128804<br>
After 5000 training steps, loss on training batch is 0.106437<br>
After 6000 training steps, loss on training batch is 0.100282<br>
After 7000 training steps, loss on training batch is 0.089194<br>
After 8000 training steps, loss on training batch is 0.0838311<br>
After 9000 training steps, loss on training batch is 0.0725235<br>
After 10000 training steps, loss on training batch is 0.0720523<br>
After 11000 training steps, loss on training batch is 0.0639354<br>
After 12000 training steps, loss on training batch is 0.0574177<br>
After 13000 training steps, loss on training batch is 0.0567616<br>
After 14000 training steps, loss on training batch is 0.0527242<br>
After 15000 training steps, loss on training batch is 0.0520488<br>
After 16000 training steps, loss on training batch is 0.0477616<br>
After 17000 training steps, loss on training batch is 0.0452654<br>
After 18000 training steps, loss on training batch is 0.0446994<br>
After 19000 training steps, loss on training batch is 0.0436124<br>
After 20000 training steps, loss on training batch is 0.0393574<br>
After 21000 training steps, loss on training batch is 0.0380176<br>
After 22000 training steps, loss on training batch is 0.0408154<br>
After 23000 training steps, loss on training batch is 0.0405596<br>
After 24000 training steps, loss on training batch is 0.0402395<br>
After 25000 training steps, loss on training batch is 0.0402755<br>
After 26000 training steps, loss on training batch is 0.0397783<br>
After 27000 training steps, loss on training batch is 0.0345256<br>
After 28000 training steps, loss on training batch is 0.0337152<br>
After 29000 training steps, loss on training batch is 0.0326353<br>
After 30000 training steps, loss on training batch is 0.0296798<br>
可以看出模型的训练的结果是使得训练集的误差在不断的下降<br>
## 第三部分是模型的评估函数
After 30000 training steps validation accuracy = 0.9854<br>
可以看出运行的结果中，在测试集的效果还是不错的<br>
